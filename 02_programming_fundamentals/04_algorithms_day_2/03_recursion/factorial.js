// A factorial is the multiplication of a number by all numbers
// preceding it until 1.
// For instance, fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
// It does not work for negative numbers and your function
// should return `null` if tried with a negative number or
// with something else than a number.
//
// Remember that you can call `fact` inside of itself


function fact(n) {
  // your code here
}


// do not remove this line, it is for tests
module.exports = fact;
